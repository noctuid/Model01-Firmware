** Maybe Eventually
- maybe useful for tmux: https://github.com/jamesnvc/Kaleidoscope-PrefixLayer; or just use a modifier for tmux keybindings
- https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/docs/plugins/WinKeyToggle.md
- https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/docs/plugins/GhostInTheFirmware.md

* TODO Macro to insert keyboard layout as text
* TODO Sxhkd Integration
Problems
- Acts as qwerty versions (maybe can simulate all keys explicitly on a layer)
# - have to release and press modifier again to do more than one action (actually this seems to be okay now?)
- Gui + Alt key causes some issues with modifers being locked; using a macro doesn't work at all

* TODO ShapeShifter Issue
